# JSWeb

## Instructions
Encode your whole web using JS document.write(...)
or just have fun with your favourite payload.

Then, append it in url format to:
https://dgonzalez55.github.io/JSWeb/#%0a

The %0a break the line and do the trick using JS labels,
since all the text before it will be commented through //
except the protocol https: that acts as a JS label.

Now, use a shortener service as a free web hosting.
More fun? Use your own domain, just think about it.

index.html contains the full code in just 42 bytes:
```<script>eval(unescape(location));</script>```
